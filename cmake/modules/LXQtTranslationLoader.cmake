# These functions enables "automatic" translation loading in LXQt Qt6 apps
#   and libs. They generate a .cpp file that takes care of everything. The
#   user doesn't have to do anything in the source code.
#
# Typical use:
#   include(LXQtTranslationLoader)
#   lxqt_app_translation_loader(lxqt-app_QM_LOADER ${PROJECT_NAME})
#   add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME}
#       ${lxqt-app_QM_LOADER}
#       ...
#   )


# lxqt_app_translation_loader(<source_files> <catalog_name>)
#       <source_files> The generated .cpp file is added to <source_files>
#       <catalog_name> Translations catalog to be loaded
function(lxqt_app_translation_loader source_files catalog_name)
    configure_file(
        ${LXQT_CMAKE_MODULES_DIR}/LXQtAppTranslationLoader.cpp.in
        LXQtAppTranslationLoader.cpp @ONLY
    )
    set(${source_files} ${${source_files}} ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/LXQtAppTranslationLoader.cpp PARENT_SCOPE)
endfunction()

# lxqt_lib_translation_loader(<source_files> <catalog_name>)
#       <source_files> The generated .cpp file is added to <source_files>
#       <catalog_name> Translations catalog to be loaded
function(lxqt_lib_translation_loader source_files catalog_name)
    configure_file(

# lxqt_plugin_translation_loader(<source_files> <catalog_name>)
#       <source_files> The generated .cpp file is added to <source_files>

#       <plugin_type> Plugin type. Example: lxqt-panel
